            <p id="intro">As a youngstar, Sports was always in my vein. Had the dream to be a cricketer as a school boy.
                But
                couldn't fulfill that dream. Yet the passion for cricket or any other sports, never died. So, it was
                decided
                by my fate that I would be always connected to sports and thus started my journey as a Sports
                Journalist.
                Welcoming all of you to my arena </p>

        <h3>To contribute in Bangladesh Sports Industry</h3>
        <p id="objective">I have already learned some basics of Sports Journalism as well as reporting. As I've covered
            various internation series and domestic tournament in Bangladesh, I've some knowledge about this. Now I'm
            looking forward to use my experience to contribute in this sector. I believe Sports Journalism isn't just
            about collecting news and publishing that. Journalism should've impact in this field.
