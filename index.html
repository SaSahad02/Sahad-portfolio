            <h3>Sports Journalist and Enthusiastic</h3>
            <p>As a youngstar, Sports was always in my vein. Had the dream to be a cricketer as a school boy.
                But
                couldn't fulfill that dream. Yet the passion for cricket or any other sports, never died. So, it was
                decided
                by my fate that I would be always connected to sports and thus started my journey as a Sports
                Journalist.
                Welcoming all of you to my arena.</p>

        <h3>To contribute in Bangladesh Sports Industry</h3>
        <p>I have already learned some basics of Sports Journalism as well as reporting. As I've covered
            various internation series and domestic tournament in Bangladesh, I've some knowledge about this. Now I'm

            about collecting news and publishing that. Journalism should've impact in this field.

            <h3>Sports Reporter| 2018-Present</h3>
            <p>
                Started my Journey as a Sports Reporter from September 2018. But not as full time reporter. I've also
                worked
                as a Desk Reporter as well in this period. This has been a learning period for me. which is really very
                enjoyable. Sometimes it is challenging as online newsportal always has the urgency to publish faster
                than
                anyone. Overall I see myself as a sports enthusiastic who is really eager to do something impacfull is
                this
                industry.

            <h3>Newsroom Editor| 2017-2018</h3>
            <p>My journey as a sports journalist started from Khelarghor.com. Where I got to learn how to write a proper
                news article. That was total challenging journey because I was just a noob there. But when leaving that
                site, I got much appreciation as a quick learner.</p>
